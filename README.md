# goit-react-hw-07-phonebook

the goit-react-hw-07-phonebook project was created as part of the GoIt course.

The goit-react-hw-07-phonebook project is a refactored goit-react-hw-06-phonebook project. The code responsible for adding and deleting contacts to local storage has been removed and replaced with the mockapi.io backend. Now all addition and deletion operations happen in the backend and not in local storage
